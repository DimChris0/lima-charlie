# Release 3.1

## Features
* Kernel based collection of DNS on OSX and Windows.
* Slack integration, see the [how-to](https://github.com/refractionpoint/limacharlie/wiki/Slack-App), basically enables organizations to set a Slack community (via OAuth tokens) where detections and investigations are materialized via a bot. It also allows users to send commands to the bot to task sensors in real time and query the object model to get info like "which hosts queried any subdomain of evil.com?".
* Lots of bug fixes.
