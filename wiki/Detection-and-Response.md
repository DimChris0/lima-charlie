Detect lambdas are designed to allow you to push out a detection rule and with a custom action in record time. Think of it like a `lambda` in various programming languages. They can be added and removed from the web ui and they become immediately available/running as they are set. They are simple to read one-liners.

Besides using a lambda for matching on behaviors observed from sensors, you can also set a lambda that describes an action that should be taken when those occur.

To give you a taste, here is a short term mitigation written for Wanacry (remember those fun few days) written in about 2 minutes:

**Match**: `event.Process( pathEndsWith = '@wanadecryptor@.exe' )`

**Action**: `sensor.task( [ 'deny_tree', event.atom() ] ) and sensor.task( [ 'history_dump' ] ) and report( name = 'wanacry' )` |

## Matching Rules
A matching rule that evaluates to `True` will "fire" the associated action (described below). The rule has available to it the `event` object that represents the event being evaluated, and the `sensor` object that has an `aid` variable that is the Agent Id where the event originates, and an `sensor.isTagged( "tag_name" )` method.

### Event Selection
`event.Process()`: the rule will only apply to events that contain process information.

`event.ParentProcess()`: access the parent process of the event, if it is contained within the same event.

`event.Dns()`: the rule will only apply to `DNS_REQUEST` events.

`event.Hash()`: the rule will only apply to events that report the hash of a piece of code.

`event.NetworkSummary()`: the rule will only apply to `NETWORK_SUMMARY` events.

`event.Connections()`: the rule will only apply to events that contain network connection information.

`event.UserObserved()`: the rule will only apply to `USER_OBSERVED` events.

`event.StartingUp()`: the rule will only apply to `STARTING_UP` events.

`event.Sync()`: the rule will only apply to `SYNC` events.

### Characteristic Selection
`path = `: the file path equals.

`pathEndsWith = `: the file path ends with.

`pathStartsWith = `: the file path starts with.

`pathMatches = `: the file path matches the regular expression.

`commandLine = `: the process command line equals.

`commandLineEndsWith = `: the process command line ends with.

`commandLineStartsWith = `: the process command line starts with.

`commandLineMatches = `: the process command line matches the regular expression.

`user = `: the user name equals.

`userEndsWith = `: the user name ends with.

`userStartsWith = `: the user name starts with.

`userMatches = `: the user name matches the regular expression.

`domain = `: the domain name equals.

`domainEndsWith = `: the domain name ends with.

`domainStartsWith = `: the domain name starts with.

`domainMatches = `: the domain name matches the regular expression.

`cname = `: the CNAME (in a DNS request) equals.

`cnameEndsWith = `: the CNAME (in a DNS request) ends with.

`cnameStartsWith = `: the CNAME (in a DNS request) starts with.

`cnameMatches = `: the CNAME (in a DNS request) matches the regular expression.

`ip = `: the IP address equals.

`ipEndsWith = `: the IP address ends with.

`ipStartsWith = `: the IP address starts with.

`ipIn = `: the IP address is within the network (CIDR notation).

`hash = `: the hash (sha256) equals.

`userId = `: the user id (as in 0 == `root`) equals.

`dstIpIn = `: the destination IP address is within the network (CIDR notation).

`srcIpIn = `: the source IP address is within the network (CIDR notation).

`dstPort = `: the destination port equals.

`srcPort = `: the source port equals.

`isOutgoing = `: the network connection is outgoing.

### Examples
`event.Dns( domainEndsWith = ".3322.org" ) and sensor.isTagged( "server" )`: matches all DNS requests to a domain ending with `.3322.org` and where the sensor has the "server" tag.

`event.Process( pathEndsWith = "Google Chrome Helper" ) and event.Connections( dstPort = 1900 )`: matches all processes who's name ends with `Google Chrome Helper`, and which have a network connection to port `1900`, note that this indirectly refers to a `NETWORK_SUMMARY` event since they are the only ones containing both a network connection and process information.

## Action
The action states what should happen when the matching rule "fires". It has access to the `event` object (like the Matching rules) and the `sensor` object.

The `sensor` object can also `sensor.tag( "new_tag" )` (or `.untag( "old_tag" )`) to apply a new tag to the sensor, and `sensor.task( [ "command", "arg1", ... ] )` to send a tasking to the sensor. The actual commands are documented in the command line interface `admin_cli.py` that can be found [here](https://github.com/refractionPOINT/lc_cloud/blob/master/beach/hcp/admin_cli.py#L703).

A `report( name = "detection_name", content = event )` function to create a detect.

And a `page( to = "some@gmail.com", subject = "email subject", data = event )` to send an email page somewhere.

## Details
To see details on various functions available, see [code](https://github.com/refractionPOINT/lc_cloud/blob/develop/beach/hcp/utils/EventInterpreter.py#L163).

Additionally, complete event data is available through the `event.data` and metadata through `event.mtd`.

More complex stateless detections, loaded by URL (like the old Capabilities system) are available, examples to follow. To load one, simple put the file URL in the `Matching` section instead of a lambda. The file must contain a class named the same name as the file. This class must have a prototype like this:

```
class SomeStatelessDetection( object ):
    def __init__( self, fromActor ):
        # fromActor is a reference to the Actor running this, use it to get Beach virtual handles etc.
        pass

    def analyze( self, event, sensor, *args ):
        pass
```

Stateful detections are only available through the loading of a file (not lambdas) as mentioned above. The prototype for this is:

```
class SomeStatefulDetection( object )
    def __init__( self, fromActor ):
        # fromActor is a reference to the Actor running this, use it to get Beach virtual handles etc.
        pass

    def getDescriptor( self ):
        # This must return a single StateMachineDescriptor() as with the old Stateful detections.
        pass
```

More complex actions, loaded by URL (like the old Hunter in the Capabilities system) are available, examples to follow. To load one, simple put the file URL in the `Action` section instead of a lambda. The file must contain a class named the same name as the file. This class must have a prototype like this:

```
class SomeHunter( object )
    def __init__( self, fromActor ):
        # fromActor is a reference to the Actor running this, use it to get Beach virtual handles etc.
        pass

    def respond( self, event, sensor, context, report, page, *args ):
        pass
```

Finally, a `Matching` section (lambda or complex file-based stateless detection) may return a `tuple()` instead of a simple boolean. If that is the case, the first element of the tuple is a `True`/`False` indication of whether a match was successful, and the second element is a context that will be passed to the `Action` section as a variable named `context` like: `( event.Process( pathEndsWith = ".evil" ), event.data.values()[ 0 ][ "base.FILE_PATH" ] )` to match on processes with a path ending in `.evil` and giving the `Action` section a `context` equal to the actual path in the event.

| Detect if an executable running as root gets a connection on port 80. | `event.Process( userId = 0 ) and event.Connections( srcPort = 80, isOutgoing = False )` | `report( name = 'root_in_80', content = event ) and sensor.task( [ 'history_dump' ] )` |
